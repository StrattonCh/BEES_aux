# 2023/02/02 paper discussion

## Purpose

Review of [The recent past and promising future for data integration methods to estimate species' distributions](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13110) [@miller2019a] led by Jacob Oram. 

## Notes and focused questions

### Question 1: Who is the audience of this paper?

- quantitative ecologists
- statisticians
- it's pretty accessible with any terms well defined
- statistically savvy wildlife managers, or others that have access to multiple data streams for monitoring
- someone who is ecologically motivated and has a working knowledge of statistics

### Question 2: What are the canonical references (papers) for these methods?

- Pacifici, 2017
- MacKenzie et al
- Guisan & Thuiller
- Phillips, Anderson & Schapire
- Reich, Pacifici & Stallings
- really wide array depending on what models you're focusing on 

### Question 3: What do the authors already assume the readers know?

- at least a vague knowledge Poisson processes
- working knowledge of SDMs
- working knowledge of occupancy modeling framework
- working knowledge of data integration and how that differs from just analyzing one data set, or two data sets separately

### Question 4: What problem is the paper addressing? What is the motivation? Some generic examples: include resolving a deficiency, exploring a new situation/data, making an extension, addressing computational limitations, enhancing fidelity,...

- the whole class of methods is trying to harness more information 
- review of various data integration methods used in ecology

### Question 5: What do you like or could you use in your own writing and research?

- the table of terms and definitions on pg 2 (Table 1)
- quotes from the book, "Sea of Cortex" - Steinbeck and Ricketts (1941)
- worked example (that's in the Appendix, makes the paper accessible)
- the structure looks different for a lit-review style paper (like this) vs the alternative
- key ideas in conclusion (1-5 bulleted list)
- the flow of the paper was excellent
- synergize the terminology around data integration

### Discussion of Figure 2

- the joint species distribution model models the same parameter or a set of shared parameters
- the covariate image describes using one data set of estimated parameters as a set of covariates to model another process
  - it is possible (and likely?) to underestimate uncertainty here
- covariate method is the most approachable

### Discussion of validation

- do we really add value with including another data source? 
- could incorporate decision analysis

### How do the authors know each other? 

- in the acknowledgements: potentially SAMSI Mathematical/Statistical Ecology workshop
