__Title:__ Stratified-by-species sampling for validation of acoustic monitoring data

__Author:__ Jacob Oram

__Abstract:__ Large-scale monitoring programs increasingly use autonomous recording units (ARUs) to efficiently gather data from species assemblages, which are then used in statistical models to estimate ecological parameters of interest and inform conservation decisions. Typically, ARU observations are pre-processed and classified to species using automated software algorithms. This process is known to introduce misclassification errors in species labels at the observation level, which can bias estimates of ecological parameters if ignored in statistical models. Manual verification of a subset of observations by trained experts (i.e., coupled classification) is one available method of accounting for misclassification within the statistical model. However, previous investigations of coupled classification and validation effort found an impractical number of verified ARU recordings were required to obtain consistent model convergence of rare species classification parameters. We conduct a simulation study that explores stratified-by-species sampling of ARU recordings, allowing unequal validation effort for different species and providing a flexible framework for reducing validation costs for practitioners. We found that 1) for rare and relatively inactive species, validating 100% of calls is a viable avenue for obtaining reliable inference of occurrence and relative activity parameters, and 2) the greatest cost savings can be obtained by reducing effort for extremely prevalent and active species (when present), and assigning effort to remaining species according to monitoring objectives. Our findings indicate that a tailored vetting design based on cost constraints and monitoring priorities can provide researchers with control of the programmatic costs of implementing a coupled-classification model for ecological studies.

# 2023/02/02 paper discussion

Review of [The recent past and promising future for data integration methods to estimate species' distributions](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13110) [@miller2019a] led by Jacob Oram. 

## Notes and focused questions

The following focus questions were selected by Jacob prior to the discussion. Notes taken by Meaghan Winder.

### Question 1: Who is the audience of this paper?

- quantitative ecologists
- statisticians
- it's pretty accessible with any terms well defined
- statistically savvy wildlife managers, or others that have access to multiple data streams for monitoring
- someone who is ecologically motivated and has a working knowledge of statistics

### Question 2: What are the canonical references (papers) for these methods?

- Pacifici, 2017
- MacKenzie et al
- Guisan & Thuiller
- Phillips, Anderson & Schapire
- Reich, Pacifici & Stallings
- really wide array depending on what models you're focusing on 

### Question 3: What do the authors already assume the readers know?

- at least a vague knowledge Poisson processes
- working knowledge of SDMs
- working knowledge of occupancy modeling framework
- working knowledge of data integration and how that differs from just analyzing one data set, or two data sets separately

### Question 4: What problem is the paper addressing? What is the motivation? Some generic examples: include resolving a deficiency, exploring a new situation/data, making an extension, addressing computational limitations, enhancing fidelity,...

- the whole class of methods is trying to harness more information 
- review of various data integration methods used in ecology

### Question 5: What do you like or could you use in your own writing and research?

- the table of terms and definitions on pg 2 (Table 1)
- quotes from the book, "Sea of Cortex" - Steinbeck and Ricketts (1941)
- worked example (that's in the Appendix, makes the paper accessible)
- the structure looks different for a lit-review style paper (like this) vs the alternative
- key ideas in conclusion (1-5 bulleted list)
- the flow of the paper was excellent
- synergize the terminology around data integration

### Discussion of Figure 2

- the joint species distribution model models the same parameter or a set of shared parameters
- the covariate image describes using one data set of estimated parameters as a set of covariates to model another process
  - it is possible (and likely?) to underestimate uncertainty here
- covariate method is the most approachable

### Discussion of validation

- do we really add value with including another data source? 
- could incorporate decision analysis

### How do the authors know each other? 

- in the acknowledgements: potentially SAMSI Mathematical/Statistical Ecology workshop
